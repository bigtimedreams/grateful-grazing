Grateful Grazing is my love-letter to seasonal flavors, hand-carved boards, and the joy that happens when people gather around great food.\n\nFrom backyard baby showers to 200-guest weddings, my mobile cart rolls in, sets up, and lets you soak in the moment—no dishes, no stress, just gratitude & grazing.",
